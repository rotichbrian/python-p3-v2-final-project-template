## Task Management System

## Description

The Task Management System is a CLI-based application that allows users to manage tasks effectively. Users can create, update, delete, and view tasks, categories, and users. This project uses SQLite for the database and follows ORM principles to interact with the database.

## How to Run

To run the Task App Manager locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Create and activate a virtual environment using the following respectively commands pipenv install and pipenv shell.

3. Install dependencies using the pip install command(pip install tabulate
).

4. Start the React app with the following command 'npm start'.

5. The tasks information will be displayed in the web page including title, description, priority, and the due date.

## Technologies used

Python 3.8
SQLite
pipenv (for dependency management)
tabulate (for displaying tables in CLI)

## Functionality

1. Task App Manager: The app fetches tasks data using the json server.

2. Viewing Button: The button enables the user to be able to view his/her task on another page and this will enable him to delete the task as the delete button is on that page.

3. Edit Button: Enables the user to edit the added task.
